-Download the latest Linux Mint Mate. This has not been tested with Cinnamon - should work though

-Create a bootable usb(8gb): 
-From linux, use mintstick. It's part of the standard included apps.
-From OSX use etcher - https://etcher.io/

-Using disk utility, create three new partitions.
-With the new filesystem APFS, make sure to "partition" instead of "add volume" in this operation. 
-Add 3 partitions to the hd into non-afps partitions, and format as fat32.

-NOTE - This step was a little troublesome. A little freezing happened and rebooting required. There was no damage to the HD though.

-The 3 partitions can be as such:
SWAP - 4gb is good enough (no more space than your computer has ram)
LINUX - 20gb - 50gb - This is for the system
HOME - As much as you can afford - This is your hd.

Shutdown your computer.

-NOTE- for the installation, it is a good idea to have a wired connection. WiFi is possible however.

-Insert the USB

Continue.

In the partitioning section find your 3 partitions. 

-You may identify them as the only partitions formatted as fat32.
-You may have to identify the specific partitions by size as the names aren't used.

-To change the properties of the partitions, select the partition in the menu and click the change... button in the bottom left next to the + and - buttons.

-Set the SWAP partition to be formatted as swap.
