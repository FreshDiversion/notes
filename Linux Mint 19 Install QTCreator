the package requires that it be installed from the command line. It will place all the files in the right places.

Though it is for an older versions of Linux Mint and QTCreator, it is a good reference. This forum page describes the process:

This is the condensed/updated version:

-Make sure clang is installed
clang --version

-If it is not, install clang
sudo apt install clang

After downloading, move the installer to your home directory.

Navigate to the qt-creator-opensource-linux-x86_64-4.6.1.run.

Change the permissions:
chmod u+x qt-creator-opensource-linux-x86_64-4.6.1.run

Run the installer:
sudo ./qt-creator-opensource-linux-x86_64-4.6.1.run

If you do not have a qt account, create one and follow the installation guide.

NOTE: Be sure it installs in /opt/Qt4.6.1 - if it does not, you can change it. This is essential. Do not install in your home directory.

Let the installer do it's job. No need to change any of the install packages.

Once the installer is finished, check your all applications menu. A programming section should be visible with qtcreator in the sub section.

Install the OpenFrameworks qtcreator plugin:

Quit qtcreator if it auto launched from the installer.

Return to the OF/scripts/qtcreator directory.

cd OF/scripts/qtcreator

Install the plugin:

./install_template.sh

Launch QTCreator.
