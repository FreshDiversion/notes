Install Open frameworks
I am using the 64 bit linux version

Download from here:
http://openframeworks.cc/download/

Move the tar.gz file to your home directory or extract to the home directory.

Rename the extracted folder to OF (this makes the copy/paste of commands into the terminal easier).

Follow the directions on the openframeworks linux install page:
http://openframeworks.cc/setup/linux-install/

If internet is not available:

Install dependencies:

-Navigate to the scripts directory
cd OF/scripts/linux/ubuntu

-run the installer script
sudo ./install_dependencies.sh

-Install codecs from the same directory(OPTIONAL)
sudo ./install_codecs.sh

Compile OpenFrameworks:

This command requires that the -j3 be set to the number of cores your machine is using(-j2, -j1)

-Navigate to the OF/scripts/linux directory:
cd OF/scripts/linux

-Run the script with the proper amount of cores
./compileOF.sh -j2

Test your install:

-Navigate to the ploygon example:
cd OF/examples/graphics/polygonExample

-Make the example:
make

-Run the example
make RunRelease

If the example does not run, follow the directions again, visit the openframeworks directions, post a question in the forums.

Install the project generator(OPTIONAL):

cd OF/scripts/linux
./compilePG.sh
