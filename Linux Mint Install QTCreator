QTCREATOR
Download QTCreator
 
At this point, this is the only QTCreator package I have been able to see fully working on linux mint:

direct link:
http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.2/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.6.2.run

the package requires that it be installed from the command line. It will place all the files in the right places.

Though it is for an older versions of Linux Mint and QTCreator, it is a good reference. This forum page describes the process:
https://forum.qt.io/topic/24693/how-to-install-qt-5-0-x-in-linux-mint/

This is the condensed/updated version:

Navigate to the qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.6.2.run file.

Change the permissions:
chmod u+x qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.6.2.run

Run the installer:
sudo ./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.6.2.run

If you do not have a qt account, create one and follow the installation guide.

NOTE: Be sure it installs in /opt/Qt5.6.2 - if it does not, you can change it. This is essential. Do not install in your home directory.

Let the installer do it's job. No need to change any of the install packages.

Once the installer is finished, check your all applications menu. A programming section should be visible with qtcreator in the sub section.


Install the OpenFarameworks qtcreator plugin:

Quit qtcreator if it auto launched from the installer.

Return to the OF/scripts/qtcreator directory.

cd OF/scripts/qtcreator

Install the plugin:

./install_template.sh


-Make sure clang is installed
clang --version

-If it is not, install clang
sudo apt-get install clang


Launch QTCreator.

Help -> about plugnins

Exit QTCreator
Launch QTCreator
select new project
select openframeworks from the left hand menu

Here you can create a new or import a previous project. For a test, select new.

Give the project a name

next

Set the location to /home/YOURUSERNAME/OF/apps/myApps or where ever you have your openframeworks installation.

next

confirm the path to openframeworks

next

Here you can install addons for your project, for the test it is not necessary.

next

The last panel offers project management options.

Finish

The development environment will appear. To the left, you should see folders for openFrameworks and a folder with the name of your project.

In the bottom left of the environment press the play button (the one without the bug)

The project should compile and spawn a blank window.

Try writting a simple app that places an image in the window.

Find a .jpg image that is preferrably 1024 x 768 - but not essential

Create a directory called images in your projects bin/data and place the image inside. Remember the name of your image.

In ofApp.h:

ofImage testImage;


in ofApp.cpp:

void ofApp::setup(){
 testImage.load("images/MY_IMAGE_NAME.jpg");
}


void ofApp::draw(){
 testImage.draw(0, 0, 1024, 768);
}


In the bottom left of the environment press the play button (the one without the bug)

Your image should appear in the window. Your installation and test is complete.
